# Customizations

- configured assetic filters for:
    - CoffeeScript
    - SASS/SCSS (with ScssPhp, better switching to the original Ruby Sass implementation)
- configured Haml/Twig template engine
- configured eloquent/composer-npm-bridge for installation of NPM packages
- installed bower with NPM for frontend dependencies management

# TODO

- configure assetic filters for images optimization
- install FOSRestBundle
- find a way to tidy html in dev and to minify in prod
